## Homework 1

Discuss in your teams what a decentralized version of a game like monopoly would be like, if there was no software on a central server.

Consider
- What are the essential pieces of functionality?
- How would people cheat?
- How could you prevent them from cheating?

This is just a general discussion, there is no need to write any code or do any detailed design.

 **1. What are the essential pieces of functionality?**
  - The Bank must be a decentralized network to handle the transactions, and be able to execute the task requested by each case on the board (smart-contracts). 
    - Money issuance should be done automatically when the banks runs out of money (printing)
    - Transactions among player must be P2P and avoiding double-spending (for rent) 
    - Auction should be automatic
    - Properties must be unique, with automatic collection of rent from income passing over it.
    - Mortgage must be automatically issued. 
  - The Dice must be provably random
 **2. How would people cheat?**
  - Cheat on their balance (how much they have)
  - Cheat on their assets (what assets they hold)
 **3. How could you prevent them from cheating?**
